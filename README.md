# NRMS_project_02456
*Deep Learning - 02456 - NRMS - GPR 127*

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files:
- The_forward_pass
  - *is solely intended to test the trained model on which the results in the report are based.*   
- nrms_code_original_ipynb
  - *is the full script, where graphs from the training loop can also be viewed.* 

To run them, the folder from Google Drive must be downloaded:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lIa75My9wQfdNiKj9llw0A8QIV9SRp1v?usp=sharing 

In the folder from Google Drive, there are two additional files, as well as the weights that the script *The_forward_pass* uses to perform the forward pass again. This is also illustrated in the figure below:
